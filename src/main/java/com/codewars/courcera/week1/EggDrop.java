* Egg drop. Suppose that you have an n-story building
* (with floors 1 through nn) and plenty of eggs.
* An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor TT or higher and does not break otherwise.
* Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine
* the value of TT given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:
*
* Version 0: 1 egg, \le T≤T tosses.
* Version 1: ∼1lgn eggs and ∼1lgn tosses.
* Version 2: ∼lgT eggs and ∼2lgT tosses.
* Version 3: 22 eggs and ∼2n‾‾√ tosses.
* Version 4: 22 eggs and \le c \sqrt T≤c
​* tosses for some fixed constant cc.
